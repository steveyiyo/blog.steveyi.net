è˜¿è”” has been searching for free and easy-to-use streaming music platforms for the past few years, so she has almost used all the common platforms in Taiwan. Therefore, she will introduce each platform to you one by one.

First of all, è˜¿è”” is Taiwanese, so some of the platforms introduced in this article may not be available in other countries or regions, and some platforms may have been updated and this article may not have been updated in time. Please forgive her.

Next, she would like to say that she does not encourage the use of pirated or cracked versions. First of all, music platforms and music creators cannot receive money (such as the advertising sponsorship fees on streaming music platforms), and good music cannot be encouraged. Devices may also be invaded by viruses or spyware, and there may also be legal liabilities.

Now that she has finished talking about that, let's start introducing the platforms.

Spotify
-------

This is an old streaming music platform, mainly focused on playlists. It has Spotify Connect that allows you to seamlessly switch listening devices. Recently, it has gradually opened up the lyrics function, but it seems that only Premium users can use it.  
Free members can choose to play on tablet computers, computer apps, and computer webpages, with interspersed advertisements, and the sound quality cannot be set to "highest".  
If you use it on a mobile phone or iPod touch, it is limited to random play, and you can only skip six songs per hour (some designated personalized playlists can be selected for playback without this limit).  
Interestingly, è˜¿è””'s large-screen mobile phone is regarded as a tablet, so she can choose to play on demand ðŸ¤£

KKBOX
-----

This is an old streaming music service, which was launched earlier than Spotify. It has more Chinese songs than Spotify and has dynamic lyrics.  
After registration, you can use almost all functions for a three-day trial membership. After the trial membership expires, you will become a regular member, but the number of trial member accounts that can be logged in on each device is limited.  
Regular members cannot set the sound quality to the highest (320kbps), and there will be one advertisement per day. After watching the advertisement, you can listen to 20 songs for free, and after that, you can only preview each song for 30 seconds.  
Experience codes are sometimes released online periodically.

MyMusic
-------

After registration, you can use all functions for a 7-day trial membership. After the trial membership expires, you will become a regular member.  
Regular members can only set the sound quality to normal (128kbps), and only a few designated playlists can be listened to in full, while other songs can only be previewed for 30 seconds. Experience codes are sometimes released online periodically.

No advertisements and has dynamic lyrics.  
After registration, you can use all functions for a 7-day trial membership. After the trial membership expires, you will become a regular member.  
Regular members can only set the sound quality to normal (128kbps), and can only play five songs per day, and after that, they can only preview each song for 30 seconds.  
Experience codes are sometimes released online periodically.

Apple Music
-----------

It is highly integrated with the Apple ecosystem and has beautiful dynamic lyrics (you need to upgrade to iOS/iPad OS 13 or above; iOS 10 only has static lyrics).  
You need to pay first to get a three-month trial, and the Android app does not feel very smooth to use. The Android version also often encounters bugs, but it is indeed very convenient to call Siri to play songs directly on Apple Watch if you use an iPhone. Sometimes, free trial codes sponsored by singers or radio stations are also released online.  
The official system requirements are iOS 8.4/Android 5.0/iTunes 12.2 or above.

NetEase Cloud Music
-----

If you want to listen to the entire music library, you need to use a VPN software (such as Shuttle VPN). Without a VPN, it will turn gray as shown in the picture. It has dynamic lyrics, on-demand play, no interspersed advertisements, but most songs can only be set to 128Kbps, and there are few English songs. Some songs can be downloaded, and there are also some exclusive music.

Xiami Music
----

You can often sign up to receive a trial membership, but è˜¿è”” feels that the music library is smaller than that of NetEase Cloud Music and QQ Music. Some songs require a VPN (such as Shuttle VPN), and it has dynamic lyrics, and some songs can be downloaded, but there are few English songs.

Almost all songs in the library require a VPN (such as Shuttle VPN), it has dynamic lyrics (word by word), and there are few English songs.

MixerBox 3
----------

This is an MV player based on YouTube, but on iOS, you have to press play from the control center every time you leave the app, while on Android, there will be a small floating window, which is slightly inconvenient. Moreover, because it is MV, some MVs with interspersed dialogue will affect the listening experience. Some people play music together on this platform, and the exploration page can often find music suitable for oneself. The music alarm clock function can make waking up more interesting.
