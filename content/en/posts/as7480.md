# History

IANA earlier assigned AS7467 - 7722 to APNIC and APNIC assigned it to their members or other legal entities.

Recently, Jason decided to change their network service provider. It's mean they didn't need multihoming, so he decided to transfer AS Number to me.

# Action transfer

## Step 0. Confirm Transfer Policies

## Step 1. Make a request to APNIC

According to the Transfer Template in [APNIC Inter-RIR transfer of unused IPv4 addresses and/or AS numbers](https://www.apnic.net/manage-ip/manage-resources/transfer-resources/transfer-of-unused-ip-and-as-numbers/transfers-of-unused-ipv4-addresses-and-or-as-numbers-between-apnic-and-an-rir-inter-rir-transfer/) , send an email to start the Inter-RIR ASN Transfer Request.

APNIC will send an email to you to confirm the request.

## Step 2. Transfer process to RIPE NCC

Once APNIC approved the transfer request, the process will transfer to RIPE NCC.

Since it was a Friday when RIPE NCC received the transfer request, they were very busy. So the transfer was not processed until the weekend. (As an aside, the English of RIPE NCC's Dutch office staff is very fast, which is not at the same level as APNIC XD)

Since my ORG is not an LIR, the resource will be transferred to the EndUser as the Sponsor LIR.

* In general, if ORG is non-LIR, we have to look for LIR as Sponsor LIR

RIPE requested a lot of information from me in the first email and handles transfer requests in accordance with the following policies:

- [Inter-RIR Transfers](https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/resource-transfers-and-mergers/inter-rir-transfers)
- [RIPE Resource Transfer Policies](https://www.ripe.net/publications/docs/transfer-policies)
- [Inter-RIR Transfer of Internet Number Resources](https://www.ripe.net/publications/docs/inter-rir-transfer-of-inr)

Questions list:

- Initial information
- Documentation
- ID Validation via iDenfy​
- ASNs already registered to Tsung-Yi Yu (ORG-TY18-RIPE)

### Section 1 - Initial information
Is to confirm with me if you want to agree to this transfer request and become a Sponsor LIR. The next step is to confirm that there are Infras and routing policies in the RIPE NCC service area.

### Section 2 - Documentation
Due to resource transfer and sponsorship LIR. So two documents need to be signed.

- [Confirmation of Transfer to the RIPE NCC Service Region](https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/resource-transfers-and-mergers/transfers/inter-rir-transfers/inter-rir-transfer-documents/confirmation-of-transfer-to-the-ripe-ncc-service-region)
- [Requirements: End User Assignment Agreement](https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/resource-management/number-resources/independent-resources/requirements )

### Section 3 - ID Validation via iDenfy​
Since the resource is registered to a natural person, ID and other information need to be verified. This part is the same as opening a bank account, which requires KYC.

### Section 4 - ASNs already registered to Tsung-Yi Yu (ORG-TY18-RIPE)
Since I already have two AS Numbers, RIPE NCC would like to confirm with me if I want to transfer the Sponsor LIR of the existing ASN.

* Probably asking this because I'm making a request on behalf of both LIR and EndUser XD.

After all documents are signed and submitted, RIPE NCC will make final confirmation with APNIC, update WHOIS and other documents, and complete the transfer procedures.

```

At the same time, you can also see the assignment record of this ASN in the assignment file of RIPE NCC.

```
steveyiyo@SteveYis-MacBook-Pro ~ % curl https://ftp.ripe.net/pub/stats/ripencc/delegated-ripencc-latest -s | grep 'asn|7480'
ripencc|TW|asn|7480|1|19970217|allocated
```

## Step 3. Next steps

After completing the transfer, I need to update the records of other third-party platforms (Eg: PeeringDB)

Since I initiated the ownership Transfer to PeeringDB, APNIC has not yet deleted the record.

This caused their administrators to think that the owner of this ASN was not me.

After explaining, they confirmed the RIPE NCC's WHOIS record and moved.

## Step 4. Migrate the network

Before AS7480, my blackholes used AS60614 to peer with others.

We contacted the administrators of STUIX, ARIX, and Lambda-IX respectively, and replaced the Sessions of ASN and RS.

After the replacement was completed, we then contacted the NOC of Peer Sessions and also replaced the ASN together.

At the same time, we also updated the RPKI and IRR records to prevent prefix(es) from being filtered.
