This website provides six sets of music in random order, each set containing a 128Kbps MP3/320Kbps MP3/ uncompressed WAV file. The test is to see if you can identify the file with the best sound quality. After making a choice, the correct answer will be revealed.
 
Friendly reminder:
- You can turn up the volume to listen for details.
- Details can be heard more clearly in the high-pitched parts (so the choice of device is important!)
- This is not a formal test, but at least you can use it as a reference.
