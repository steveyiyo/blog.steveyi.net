Next, please go to the phone where you want to forward the messages and install [IFTTT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ifttt.ifttt&hl=zh-TW)

Note: This function only supports Android phones mentioned in this article.

If you are using Android 5.1.1 or lower, please skip the section on disabling battery optimization.

**Preparation - Disable Battery Optimization**

If you are using Android 6.0 to 8.0, after installing the app, please go to System Settings > Battery (or Power).

The operation may vary depending on the different operating systems. For example, on Google phones, you need to click on the three dots in the upper right corner first, and then click on Battery Optimization.
