I believe most of you have used Gmail before. Today, we want to introduce G Suite, an enterprise service launched by Google. However, individual users can also apply for it!

Preparation:
-----

Domain (not necessary)
Credit card/Debit card

Registration process:
-----

1. First, let's open the [G Suite official website](https://gsuite.google.com) ([https://gsuite.google.com](https://gsuite.google.com))

2. Next, click "Start Free Trial"

3. Enter the company name (or any name you want) on the top. Choose the number of employees (I selected 1). Choose the country/region (I recommend writing it accurately to prevent payment issues. I chose Taiwan).
