Previously, I shared the process of transferring a domain from Google to Gandi [click here to read the article](https://blog.steveyi.net/transfer-domain-from-google-to-gandi/). 
In this post, I will share the process of buying a domain on Gandi!

Prerequisites:
Money (for the domain registration fee)

First, we open Gandi's [official website](https://www.gandi.net/).

Search for the domain you want and add it to your shopping cart.

Then you can proceed to checkout.

Gandi supports many payment methods: credit card, UnionPay, PayPal, bank transfer, Bitcoin. 
Note that PayPal can only be used with non-Taiwanese accounts.

After completing the payment, the system will create the domain data, which can be viewed [here](https://admin.gandi.net/domain/incoming).

Once created, you will receive an email notification.

Then you can go to the [control panel](https://admin.gandi.net) to manage your domain!
