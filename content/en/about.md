I'm SteveYi, a CS Student from Taiwan.

I love Virtualizaztion Technology and usually use Proxmox VE as my Virtualization Platform.

I also operate [AS60614](https://whois.steveyi.net/whois/AS60614) and [AS209557](https://whois.steveyi.net/whois/AS209557), running my edge network.

### Learn from Community, Give back to the community

When I was fifteen, I started to learn about network engineering (Eg: BGP, OSPF, MPLS or LACP… Includeing a lot of Layer 2 & 3 technology) from the community.

In 2020, I going to lot of conferences. Eg: [COSCUP](https://coscup.org/), [SITCON](https://sitcon.org/), [MOPCON](https://mopcon.org/2020/), [g0v summit](https://g0v.tw/) and more. At the conference, I meetmet more technology friends, and communicated with each other!
