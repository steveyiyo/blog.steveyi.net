Hello! I'm Tsung-Yi Yu, widely recognized as SteveYi or "小易".

At the heart of my professional journey lies a deep fascination with internet governance research, cutting-edge internet technologies, and virtualization design. Over the years, my dedication has led me to immerse myself in pivotal events both locally and globally. I've been privileged to attend, and in many cases present at, significant conferences including APNIC 54/56, the ICANN APAC-TWNIC Engagement Forum, and the Taiwan Internet Governance Forum (TWIGF).

My enthusiasm doesn't just stop at attending; I immerse myself wholeheartedly, dedicating considerable time and effort to each venture. This is especially true when it comes to areas of public policy and the broader information domain.

In tandem with my technological pursuits, I've recently branched out into the legal sphere, aiming to merge my tech-savviness with legal proficiency. This interdisciplinary approach sets me on a unique path, and I'm eager to continue forging meaningful connections in this space.

If my journey resonates with you or if you'd like to explore potential collaborations, don't hesitate to reach out via email. Looking forward to connecting!

Happy to see you! Welcome to SteveYi's Blog.

I'm SteveYi, a CS Student from Taiwan.

I love Virtualizaztion Technology and usually use Proxmox VE as my Virtualization Platform.

I also operate [AS60614](https://whois.steveyi.net/whois/AS60614) and [AS209557](https://whois.steveyi.net/whois/AS209557), running my edge network.

### Learn from Community, Give back to the community

When I was fifteen, I started to learn about network engineering (Eg: BGP, OSPF, MPLS or LACP… Includeing a lot of Layer 2 & 3 technology) from the community.

In 2020, I going to lot of conferences. Eg: [COSCUP](https://coscup.org/), [SITCON](https://sitcon.org/), [MOPCON](https://mopcon.org/2020/), [g0v summit](https://g0v.tw/) and more. At the conference, I meetmet more technology friends, and communicated with each other!
