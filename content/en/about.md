I'm SteveYi, a CS Student from Taiwan.

I love Virtual Technology and usually use Proxmox VE as my Virtual Platform.

I also operate [AS60614](https://whois.steveyi.net/whois/AS60614) and [AS209557](https://whois.steveyi.net/whois/AS209557), run my edge network.

### Learn from Community, Give back to the community

When I was fifteen, I started to learn about network engineering (Eg: BGP, OSPF, MPLS or LACP... Include a lot of Layer 2 & 3 technology) from the community.

In 2020, I going to lot of conferences. Eg: [COSCUP](https://coscup.org/)、[SITCON](https://sitcon.org/)、[MOPCON](https://mopcon.org/2020/) and [g0v](https://g0v.tw/) more. At the conference, I meet more technology friends, communicated with each other!
