Mac comes with a useful tool that can help us reinstall the operating system easily.\nLet’s get started with the tutorial First, turn on your computer and press Command + R before the Apple logo appears. If there is a firmware password, it will need to be unlocked at this step.\nThe computer will first attempt to boot using the built-in recovery partition. If the recovery partition is not found, Internet recovery will be used.\nInternet recovery will use Wi-Fi or Ethernet. If no network is available, an exclamation point will appear next to the globe symbol.\n*If your third-party keyboard cannot find the Command key, please use the Windows symbol key as the Command key.\nScreenshot taken from the Apple official website\nIf the screen shown above does not appear, the computer will boot normally with the Apple logo.\nAfter booting, you will see the language selection screen.\nAfter selecting a language, you will see the macOS utility program.\nIf the system upgrade fails (for example, if the power is accidentally unplugged during the upgrade process), or if the kext driver is deleted by mistake, skip the Disk Utility section and go directly to the third page. This will preserve the data and applications in the system folder.\nIf you want to reinstall the system (without preserving the data in the system folder) or replace the disk drive, continue to the second page.\nNext, use the Disk Utility program to clear the data.\nSelect the startup disk or volume of the system, name it and select the format, then click “Erase”.\nIf you see the APFS format option (only available in 10.13 and above), it is recommended to select APFS.\nOtherwise, select Mac OS Extended format.\nAfter completing this step, you can close this window and return to the macOS utility program.\nNext, it’s time to reinstall the system. Please select “Reinstall macOS”.\nNext, click “Continue”, and then you will see the terms of use.\nIf you do not agree to the terms of use, you cannot install.\nThen, select the disk or volume that was just cleared.\nFinally, wait for the installation to complete!\nAfter installation, there will be basic settings. This article will not go into detail about them. We wish you a pleasant experience using your Mac!\n","wordCount":"437","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-08-15T07:25:12Z","dateModified":"2020-08-15T07:25:12Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"蘿蔔"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/macos-recovery/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"SteveYi's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.steveyi.net/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.steveyi.net/en/ accesskey=h title="SteveYi's Blog (Alt + H)">SteveYi's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li><li><a href=https://blog.steveyi.net/ title=正體中文 aria-label=正體中文>Tw</a></li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://blog.steveyi.net/en/ title="Home Page"><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.steveyi.net/en/about/ title=關於小易><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/cool_small_yi title=Twitter><span>Twitter</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Easy Mac Reinstallation with Built-in Recovery Function!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2020-08-15 07:25:12 +0000 UTC'>2020-08-15</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;蘿蔔&nbsp;|&nbsp;Translations:<ul class=i18n_list><li><a href=https://blog.steveyi.net/posts/macos-recovery/>Tw</a></li></ul></div></header><div class=post-content><p>There are many reasons why we may need to reinstall our operating system, such as the system becoming slow due to too many installed programs, not wanting to delete programs one by one, or switching to a new disk drive, downgrading from a beta version to a stable release, or unexpected power outages during system upgrades.
