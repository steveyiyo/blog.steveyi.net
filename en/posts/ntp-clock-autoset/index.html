It is said that it takes several days to correct it once).\nUnfortunately, the author’s dual-A brand PC (notebook) and the previous PC desktop (CMOS dead), whether or not it is plugged in, as long as Windows is not operating (sleep, hibernation, shutdown, crash), the clock will stop calculating time, every time you turn on the computer, you will see the date of the last time the computer was turned off (or reset), and you have to manually adjust it after opening it, which is really troublesome. Therefore, I studied the automatic time correction function of the clock and corrected it every time the computer was turned on.\nThe application used here is NTPClock launched by the National Time and Frequency Standards Laboratory. Although it is a bit old, its function is still normal.\nNTPClock installation tutorial First, please click here to download NTPClock. After downloading, please do not rush to open it. Please move the program to the “C:\\NTPClock” folder (create the folder yourself), and then right-click on the program, select [Compatibility], and then change the parameters circled in the picture in turn before opening it.\nPlease allow permission when opening, otherwise the time cannot be changed.\nNext, the program will be minimized in the system tray, and the icon can be right-clicked to exit.\nSet to automatically use NTPClock to correct time when starting up If the picture is too small, you can right-click to open it in a new tab.\nAccording to NTPClock’s default settings, the system time will be corrected every time the program is opened. Therefore, we need to use the “Task Scheduler” to set up the program to automatically start NTPClock with “administrator privileges” every time the computer is unlocked.\nFirst, please find “Task Scheduler” in Windows search.\nNext, please go to the trigger program, and adjust the settings circled in red in the figure below.\nGo to the action location, and adjust the settings circled in red in the figure below.\nGo to the condition location, and adjust the settings circled in red in the figure below.\nCorrect the picture error: uncheck “Start the task only if the computer is on AC power”\nGo to the settings location, and adjust the settings circled in red in the figure below.\nNext, set to turn off NTPClock when locking, logging out, or shutting down (sleep, hibernate, shut down) the computer (otherwise, if it is not shut down or logged out, every time you turn on the computer, another NTPClock will be opened, and after opening the computer a few more times, the taskbar will be full).\nNext, please go to the trigger program, and adjust the settings circled in red in the figure below.\nGo to the action location, and adjust the settings circled in red in the figure below.\nGo to the condition location, and adjust the settings circled in red in the figure below.\nCorrect the picture error: uncheck “Start the task only if the computer is on AC power”\nGo to the settings location, and adjust the settings circled in red in the figure below.\nNow, every time you turn on the computer, it will automatically correct the time~ If the time will run off when the computer is turned off, you don’t need to manually adjust the time every time you turn on the computer in the future!\n","wordCount":"720","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-11-20T15:52:24Z","dateModified":"2020-11-20T15:52:24Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"蘿蔔"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/ntp-clock-autoset/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"SteveYi's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.steveyi.net/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.steveyi.net/en/ accesskey=h title="SteveYi's Blog (Alt + H)">SteveYi's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li><li><a href=https://blog.steveyi.net/ title=正體中文 aria-label=正體中文>Tw</a></li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://blog.steveyi.net/en/ title="Home Page"><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.steveyi.net/en/about/ title=關於小易><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/cool_small_yi title=Twitter><span>Twitter</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Automatically Correct Time on Windows 10 After Turning on Computer (Wake Up)</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2020-11-20 15:52:24 +0000 UTC'>2020-11-20</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;蘿蔔&nbsp;|&nbsp;Translations:<ul class=i18n_list><li><a href=https://blog.steveyi.net/posts/ntp-clock-autoset/>Tw</a></li></ul></div></header><div class=post-content><p>The clock is a very important thing for computers.
