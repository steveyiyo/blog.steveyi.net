One day, when the author was modifying their Google account information, they accidentally discovered the &amp;ldquo;Ad Settings&amp;rdquo; section, which had quite a bit of information.
The data comes from various records of Google and YouTube under the login status, as well as the basic information filled out when applying for a Google account.</description></item><item><title>Automatically Correct Time on Windows 10 After Turning on Computer (Wake Up)</title><link>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/ntp-clock-autoset/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2020 15:52:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/ntp-clock-autoset/</guid><description>The clock is a very important thing for computers. It is not just about displaying the time in the status bar (or taskbar). If the clock is not correct (deviates too much from the actual time in the real world), it may cause some strange phenomena on the computer, such as: unable to view web pages (certificate issues), and even cause software crashes if the time difference is too great. Timeout login of various programs is also easy to occur when the time deviation is too large.</description></item><item><title>Backup and Restore Windows 7 and above PCs</title><link>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/windows-backup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 09:09:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/windows-backup/</guid><description>Mac has a &amp;ldquo;Time Machine&amp;rdquo; that can easily backup the entire computer, and Windows also has a similar function!
In simple terms, it will backup the entire computer, disk drive or folder (depending on the settings). The first backup will be a complete backup, so it will take longer. After the first backup, it will only backup the files that have been modified or created since the last backup to save space and time.</description></item><item><title>Changing Mac Hostname from Terminal</title><link>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/mac-hostname/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 08:25:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/mac-hostname/</guid><description>When we open the terminal, we will see a string of characters that says &amp;ldquo;username@hostname&amp;rdquo;, for example, John@Johns-MacBook.
The hostname can theoretically be changed from the &amp;ldquo;Sharing&amp;rdquo; section in System Preferences. However, for some reason, it may not work on some computers. After searching for a few days, I finally found the answer: we can change the hostname from the terminal.
First, please open the terminal and enter the following command.</description></item><item><title>Speed up email loading on old devices and slow internet with traditional version of Gmail</title><link>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/html-gmail/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2020 15:32:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/html-gmail/</guid><description>The author has an old PC with 1GB of memory and Windows XP, which is suitable for light document use (Windows XP only requires 128MB of memory to operate). It can handle browsing some websites, but some large websites take a long time to load or cannot be used normally. If it is a general article webpage, it can still be managed. The problem is that the author wants to use the Gmail web version to send and receive emails, but it takes nearly a minute to load the standard Gmail webpage when the internet is smooth, and scrolling through emails is a disaster.</description></item><item><title>A Discussion on the Impact of Battery and Performance on Mac Laptops</title><link>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/macbook-without-a-battery/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2020 13:16:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/macbook-without-a-battery/</guid><description>As someone who has used PCs since childhood, I only started using a MacBook Pro a few years ago when my family bought one (well, it&amp;rsquo;s not mine, I just borrow it for a long time ðŸ˜‚).
The first laptop I owned was an IBM ThinkPad T43. When I got it, the battery was so old that it was almost useless (it lasted about 3 minutes and 42 seconds from boot to hibernation), so most of the time I removed the battery to reduce the weight, and only installed it when I needed to move between power outlets.</description></item><item><title>How to Use an Android Phone as a Network Connection for a Mac</title><link>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/horndis/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Aug 2020 07:23:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/horndis/</guid><description>Sometimes, for various reasons, you may not want to use Wi-Fi or a personal hotspot when using the internet, or your computer&amp;rsquo;s wireless network card may be blocked by surrounding objects, or even a black Apple computer may not have a compatible wireless network card.

First, open Start&amp;gt; Settings&amp;gt; Update &amp;amp; Security.
Next, enter Windows Update settings and click on [Advanced options].

When I returned after more than a month, I discovered that I had forgotten my password (which sounds unbelievable, but it&amp;rsquo;s true; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember my previous password no matter how hard I tried).

While you may think that the audio quality of your headphones that cost just over $20 is bad, have you overlooked an important detail? Although using headphones from the same brand as your phone may result in better optimization, it cannot be denied that the built-in DAC (an important component that converts digital audio into analog signals and provides them to headphones) of your phone may not be as good as an external DAC.</description></item><item><title>Using TeamViewer to Remotely Control Android Phones</title><link>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/teamviewer-android/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2020 10:09:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/teamviewer-android/</guid><description>Do you often forget to bring your Android phone with you when you need it?
