It is currently available to all paid users, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know if there will be a chance to open it to free customers in the future. Official blog link: https://cfl.re/3efcOhv
Coincidentally, I have several domains that use the Plesk Plus service (this service has been discontinued), which is considered Cloudflare Pro version, so I can also activate this feature!</description></item></channel></rss>
