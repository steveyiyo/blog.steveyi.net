One day, when the author was modifying their Google account information, they accidentally discovered the &amp;ldquo;Ad Settings&amp;rdquo; section, which had quite a bit of information.
The data comes from various records of Google and YouTube under the login status, as well as the basic information filled out when applying for a Google account.</description></item><item><title>Easy integration with Google Drive in Linux environment</title><link>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/linux-mount-googledrive-not-required-brain/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jan 2021 12:25:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/linux-mount-googledrive-not-required-brain/</guid><description>This tutorial uses the software google-drive-ocamlfuse and the demonstration is based on the Ubuntu-based Zorin OS 15.2 system.

It can handle browsing some websites, but some large websites take a long time to load or cannot be used normally. If it is a general article webpage, it can still be managed. The problem is that the author wants to use the Gmail web version to send and receive emails, but it takes nearly a minute to load the standard Gmail webpage when the internet is smooth, and scrolling through emails is a disaster.</description></item><item><title>Experience ChromiumOS with CloudReady and Give Your Old Computer a New Life!</title><link>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/cloudready/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 15:10:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/cloudready/</guid><description>Have you ever experienced a situation where your old computer is struggling to handle basic tasks like document processing and web browsing?

Recently, I wanted to delete the G Suite organization of the Cloud Identity free version.
Since I have never deleted a G Suite organization before, I searched for information and roughly sorted out the deletion method.
Important reminder: Before deletion, please cancel the contractual authorization and delete all GCP projects. After deletion, all organization data will be cleared.</description></item><item><title>Applying for a G Suite account</title><link>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/register-gsuite/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 03:13:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.steveyi.net/en/posts/register-gsuite/</guid><description>I believe most of you have used Gmail before.
